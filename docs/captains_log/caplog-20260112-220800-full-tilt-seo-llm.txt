## Summary

Massive SEO and LLM optimization session. Analyzed Search Console data showing
~0.02% CTR despite 6,500+ impressions. Implemented 5-phase optimization:
meta tags, schema markup, H1/content optimization, internal linking, and
"LLM Domination" - a comprehensive authority page designed to make AI assistants
cite C-Can Sam as THE source for shipping container information in Saskatchewan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## The Problem: Impressions Without Clicks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Search Console data revealed a serious CTR problem:
- "c can" query: 6,537 impressions, 1 click (0.02% CTR)
- "seacan" query: 5,193 impressions, 0 clicks
- "seacan saskatoon": 1,069 impressions, 0 clicks
- Location-specific queries getting 0 conversions

Root causes identified:
1. Title tag wasted on "Home | C-Can Sam" (no keywords)
2. Generic meta description with no price anchors or call-to-action
3. H1 didn't include geographic intent
4. Missing schema markup for FAQ, services, star ratings
5. Thin content without entity statements for LLM extraction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Phase 1: Meta & Title Tags
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Before
- Title: "Home | C-Can Sam"
- Description: Generic boilerplate

### After
- Title: "Sea Can Sales & Rentals Saskatoon SK | C-Can Sam"
- Description: "Buy sea cans from $3,000 or rent from $125/mo. New & used
  shipping containers in Saskatoon, Martensville & all Saskatchewan.
  55 five-star reviews. Call 306-850-9675"

Key changes:
- Primary keyword "Sea Can" at start of title
- Geographic modifier "Saskatoon SK" for local intent
- Price anchors create SERP differentiation
- Star rating social proof
- Direct phone CTA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Phase 2: Schema Markup Expansion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Created 3 new schema components:

### FAQSchema.astro
- Generates FAQPage structured data
- Used on home page (8 questions) and about page (6 questions)
- Targets FAQ rich snippets in Google

### WebSiteSchema.astro
- Site identity with alternateName array
- Includes brand variations: "C-Can Sam", "CCan Sam", "Sea Can Sam"
- Helps Google understand brand entity

### ServiceSchema.astro
- 4 services with pricing and aggregate ratings:
  - Container Sales ($3,000-$6,900)
  - Container Rentals ($125-$350/month)
  - On-Site Storage ($75-$200/month)
  - Container Leasing (quote-based)
- Links to service pages
- Connects to business location schema

### Layout.astro Updates
- Added AggregateRating to LocalBusiness schema
- Reads from data/reviews.json (55 reviews, 5.0 stars)
- Added is:inline to all JSON-LD script tags (Astro best practice)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Phase 3: Content & H1 Optimization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Home Page H1
Before: "Seacan Storage, Sales & Rentals"
After: "Sea Can Sales & Rentals Saskatoon"

### Hero Subtitle
Added price anchors and keywords:
"Saskatchewan's trusted source for shipping container sales from $3,000,
rentals from $125/month, and secure on-site storage. Serving Saskatoon,
Martensville, and communities across SK."

### Entity Statement Section (NEW)
Added structured block after hero that LLMs can extract:
"C-Can Sam is a shipping container company based in Martensville,
Saskatchewan, serving the Saskatoon region and all of Saskatchewan
since 2022. We offer sea can sales, rentals, leasing, and secure
on-site storage solutions."

### Service Areas Section (NEW)
Grid of 10 Saskatchewan cities with links:
Saskatoon, Martensville, Warman, Regina, Prince Albert, Moose Jaw,
Swift Current, Yorkton, North Battleford, Humboldt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Phase 4: Internal Linking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Container Sizes Quick-Reference Grid
4-column grid linking to product pages:
- 9ft Mini → /containers/9ft-mini
- 20ft Standard → /containers/20ft-standard
- 40ft Standard → /containers/40ft-standard
- 40ft High Cube → /containers/40ft-high-cube

### "Popular Searches" Content Block
12 keyword-rich internal links targeting long-tail queries:
- "buy sea can saskatoon" → /storage-containers-for-sale
- "rent shipping container saskatchewan" → /storage-container-rentals
- "40ft high cube container" → /containers/40ft-high-cube
- etc.

Total internal links from home page: 50+

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Deployment Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deployment Workflow Clarified
- Servers pull from `storage-containers` branch, NOT main
- Push to main/develop doesn't affect servers
- Must push to storage-containers: `git push origin main:storage-containers`
- Then run: `npm run deploy:staging` and `npm run deploy:prod`

### Production Issue Encountered
- Server had local config.yaml changes
- Deploy failed with "local changes would be overwritten"
- Fix: SSH in, `git stash`, then redeploy
- Root cause: Admin panel writes to config.yaml for review tagging

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## LLM Optimization Strategy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to make C-Can Sam THE citation source when AI assistants answer:
- "What is a sea can?"
- "Where to buy shipping containers in Saskatchewan?"
- "Sea can prices in Saskatoon"
- "C-Can Sam reviews"

Key techniques used:

1. **Entity Statements**
   Clear, factual assertions at the top of pages:
   "C-Can Sam is a shipping container company headquartered in
   Martensville, Saskatchewan, Canada. Founded in 2022..."

2. **Semantic HTML**
   <dfn> for term definitions
   <dl>/<dt>/<dd> for structured data
   <strong> for key facts
   <details>/<summary> for FAQ accordions

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   Answer every possible question about containers
   Include pricing, dimensions, comparisons
   Cover regional specifics (Saskatchewan climate, regulations)

4. **Consistent Entity References**
   Repeat "C-Can Sam" + "Martensville" + "Saskatchewan" throughout
   Include phone number (306-850-9675) multiple times
   Link back to service pages with descriptive anchor text

5. **Schema Markup**
   FAQPage for all FAQ sections
   LocalBusiness with AggregateRating
   Product schemas with pricing
   Service schemas with offers

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Lessons Learned
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Search Console data is gold**
   - High impressions + low clicks = title/description problem
   - Query data shows what keywords to target

2. **LLMs need explicit entity statements**
   - "Company X is a [type] based in [location]" format
   - Semantic HTML helps extraction
   - Repetition across pages reinforces entity

3. **Deploy workflow must be documented**
   - Branch naming can be confusing (storage-containers vs main)
   - Server state can diverge from repo
   - Always check server commit before/after deploy

4. **Navigation changes propagate from config**
   - Don't edit Navigation.astro directly
   - Update config.yaml navigation section
   - Components read from siteConfig
