## Container Condition Grades

### New (One-Trip)
- Made one voyage from manufacturer (typically Asia) to North America
- Essentially new - minimal wear, clean interior, fresh paint
- Premium price but longest lifespan (decades)
- Best for: Long-term investments, visible locations, conversion projects, sensitive contents

### Cargo Worthy (CW)
- Still certified for international shipping
- Structurally sound, weatherproof, inspected
- Excellent choice for storage at lower price than new
- Best for: Most storage needs, functional use

### Wind and Water Tight (WWT)
- No longer shipping certified but still weatherproof
- May have surface rust, dents, cosmetic issues
- Protects contents from elements
- Best for: On-site storage, budget-conscious buyers, great value

### As-Is
- May have damage affecting weatherproofing
- Requires inspection before purchase
- Sometimes fine with minor repairs
- Best for: Covered storage situations

**Recommendation:** For most storage needs, Cargo Worthy or WWT containers offer best value - solid, weatherproof containers without paying for "like-new" condition.

---

## Pricing Information

- Container condition (new vs. used)
- Container size
- Current inventory and market conditions
- Delivery distance

**Standard Policy:**

**Response:** "Prices fluctuate based on container condition and current inventory. Let me get you an exact quote - what size are you looking at, and where would you need it delivered?"

---

## Delivery Information

### Site Preparation (Customer Responsibility)
- **Level ground:** Containers need flat, stable surface
- **Access:** Delivery trucks need room to maneuver
- **Clearance:** Consider overhead power lines and trees
- **Foundation options:** Gravel pad, concrete blocks, or railroad ties

### Delivery Methods
- **Tilt-bed truck:** Most common - needs room to tilt and slide container off
- **Crane delivery:** Required for tight spaces or over obstacles

### Permits & Regulations
- Check local bylaws about container placement
- Some municipalities require permits for permanent placement
- Consider setback requirements from property lines
- HOA rules may apply in some areas

**Pro tip:** Much harder and more expensive to move a container once placed - get position right the first time.
