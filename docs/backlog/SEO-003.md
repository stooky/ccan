# SEO-003: Add Customer Testimonials Section

**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** M (2-4 hours)
**Status:** ready
**Needs Assistance:** No

## Description
Add a dedicated testimonials/reviews section to key pages. All major competitors (ATS, BigSteelBox, Coast) prominently feature customer testimonials. We already have Google reviews in `data/reviews.json` - leverage these.

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Testimonials Component
Create a reusable `Testimonials.astro` component that:
- Pulls from existing `reviews.json` data
- Displays 3-6 featured reviews
- Shows star ratings
- Links to Google Business for more reviews

### Option B: Dedicated Reviews Page
Create `/reviews` page showing all testimonials with:
- Filter by rating
- Search functionality
- Schema markup for aggregate rating

### Option C: Both
Component for homepage/key pages + dedicated page

## Pages to Add Testimonials
- Homepage (hero or below fold)
- `/shipping-containers` (sales page)
- `/storage-container-rentals`
- `/about`

## Schema Markup
Add Review schema to individual testimonials:
```json
{
  "@type": "Review",
  "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "..." },
  "reviewRating": { "@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5" },
  "reviewBody": "..."
}
```
