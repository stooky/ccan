# SEO-005: Add "How Did You Find Us" to Forms

**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** XS (< 1 hour)
**Status:** ready
**Needs Assistance:** No

## Description
Add a "How did you hear about us?" dropdown to contact and quote forms. This provides attribution data that tracking pixels cannot capture (especially for LLM/AI referrals where referrer headers are stripped).

## Form Field Details

**Label:** "How did you hear about us?" (optional field)

**Options:**
- Google Search
- AI Assistant (ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc.)
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Friend/Family Referral
- Saw Your Container/Truck
- Returning Customer
- Other

## Implementation
1. Add field to `QuickQuoteForm.astro`
2. Add field to `TabbedContactForm.astro`
3. Update form submission handler to capture field
4. Add to submissions.json data structure
5. Display in admin panel

## Data Usage
- Track LLM attribution manually
- Understand marketing channel effectiveness
- Correlate with traffic analytics

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Field added to QuickQuoteForm
- [ ] Field added to TabbedContactForm
- [ ] Submissions capture the new field
- [ ] Admin panel displays the field
- [ ] Build passes

## Notes
- Keep as optional to not increase form friction
- Consider making it a small dropdown vs radio buttons for space
