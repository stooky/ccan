# SEO-007: Expand Keyword Variations in Content

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** S (1-2 hours)
**Status:** ready
**Needs Assistance:** No

## Description
Improve keyword coverage by using more terminology variations throughout the site. Cantrans effectively uses "sea-cans," "shipping containers," and "storage containers" interchangeably. This captures different search intents.

## Keyword Variations to Include

### Primary Terms
- Shipping container
- Storage container
- Seacan / Sea-can / Sea can
- Conex box
- Intermodal container
- ISO container

### Size Variations
- 20 foot / 20ft / 20'
- 40 foot / 40ft / 40'
- High cube / Hi-cube / HC

### Action Keywords
- Buy / Purchase / For sale
- Rent / Rental / Lease
- Deliver / Delivery
- Used / Pre-owned / Second-hand
- New / One-trip / Single-trip

### Local Variations
- Saskatchewan / SK / Sask
- Saskatoon / Stoon
- Near me / Local

## Pages to Update
1. **Homepage** - Add "seacan" and "conex" mentions
2. **Sales page** - Vary terminology in body copy
3. **Rental pages** - Include "lease" terminology
4. **City pages** - Local keyword variations
5. **Blog posts** - Natural keyword integration

## Implementation Approach
- Review each page's content
- Add 2-3 keyword variations naturally
- Update meta descriptions to include variations
- Ensure headings use primary + secondary terms
- Don't keyword stuff - keep it natural

## Example Before/After

**Before:**
"We sell shipping containers in Saskatoon."

**After:**
"We sell shipping containers and seacans in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Whether you call them storage containers, conex boxes, or ISO containers, we have what you need."
